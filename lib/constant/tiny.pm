=head1 NAME

constant::tiny - Perl pragma to declare constants

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use constant::tiny;
    use constant PI    => 4 * atan2(1, 1);
    use constant DEBUG => 0;

    print "Pi equals ", PI, "...\n" if DEBUG;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a lightweight version of Perl standard C<constant.pm>.
Here are the keys differences:

=over

=item *

only works on Perl 5.10+ in order to simplify a good part of the code

=item *

doesn't support Unicode name; please use the standard C<constant.pm>
module if you need to create constants with Unicode names

=item *

stricter rules about valid names; standard C<constant.pm> gives more
detailled diagnostics about why a given name is not valid

=back

The rationale behind this module is that recent versions of C<constant.pm>
have a better support for Unicode names. However, this means loading
full Unicode support (F<utf8_heavy.pl>) which consumes memory. In most
cases, the difference is not problematic. But in some particular cases
(embedded Perl, frequently forked programs I<E<agrave> la> CGI), the increased
memory cost can become a concern. This is even more annoying if the
program doesn't use Unicode at all and therefore pays the high price.

Hence this module, which provides a very simple solution, only requiring
you to add C<use constant::tiny> B<before> any declaration of constants.

Other than this, the usage is (nearly) exactly the same as with the
standard C<constant.pm> module. For more details, please read L<constant>.
